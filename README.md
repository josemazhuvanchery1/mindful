With Mindful, you can write your journal entry each day and it will analyze the text and give you an emoji representing the overall tone/mood, of your journaL. You can also save this tone to your calendar and track the text for why your mood was the way it was on the day you wrote it. Mindful also provides you with mindfulness youtube videos, depending on your overall mood rating. Because of Mindful users have all they need for mindfulness, all in one app.
